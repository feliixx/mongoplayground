# Mongo Playground

Mongo playground: a simple sandbox to test and share MongoDB queries. Try it online : [**https://mongoplayground.net**](https://mongoplayground.net/)


## Limitations

  ### Size limitations

  This playground has several limitations: 

  - a database can't contain more than **10 collections**
  - a collection can't contain more than **100 documents**

  ### Queries

  Currently, the playground can run only `find()`, `aggregate()` and `update()` queries 

  ### shell regex

  Currently, shell regex doesn't work in query. 

  so instead of 

  ```JSON5
  db.collection.find({
    "k": /pattern/
  })
  ```

  use 

  ```JSON5 
  db.collection.find({
    "k": {
      "$regex": "pattern"
    }
  })
  ```


## Developpement

create to directory: `storage` and `backups`, and then run the playground with docker compose: 


```
docker-compose up --build
```
